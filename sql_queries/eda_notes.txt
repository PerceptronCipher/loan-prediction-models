STEP 1: DATA EXPLORATION & QUALITY ASSESSMENT
Initial row counts:
loan_performance: 4,368 rows
customer_info: 4,334 rows  
loan_history: 363,664 rows

Check for missing relationships between tables
    Result: 1,099 customers in loan_performance missing from customer_info

Analyze data distribution across tables
    Loan_history has 4,359 unique customers vs 4,368 in loan_performance

Check for multiple loans per customer in loan_history
    Result: Confirmed multiple loans per customer (363K total records for 4.3K customers)


STEP 2: DATA CLEANING - DUPLICATE REMOVAL
Remove duplicate records from temp_customer_info table
(This was done to ensure data quality before main analysis)
Remove duplicates, keeping first occurrence of each customerid
Create clean customer_info table from deduplicated data


STEP 3: CREATE ML-READY DATASET
Join all tables keeping only complete records for machine learning
Rationale: ML models require complete data, especially for target variable

STEP 4: DATA QUALITY VERIFICATION
Verify final dataset quality
Check for any remaining null values in key columns



DATASET SUMMARY FOR ML
Final dataset contains customers with:
1. Complete demographic information
2. Complete loan performance data  
3. Valid target variable
4. No duplicate records
5. Ready for feature engineering and model training
